   cd ncmh-mental-health-platform
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

4. **Open the HTML File**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your browser
   - No build process required for basic development

5. **Make Your Changes**

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain proper indentation (4 spaces)
- Add ARIA labels for accessibility
- Keep structure clean and organized

#### CSS
- Use meaningful class names
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Comment complex styling rules
- Ensure RTL (Right-to-Left) compatibility for Arabic

#### JavaScript
- Use `var` for consistency with existing code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Maintain functional programming patterns
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Accessibility Standards

This platform must be accessible to all users:

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Test with screen readers
- Support browser zoom up to 200%

### Internationalization (i18n)

All user-facing text must be translatable:

```javascript
// Good
<button data-translate="continue">Continue</button>

// Bad
<button>Continue</button>
```

Add translations to both `english` and `arabic` sections of the `translations` object.

- Maintain the same tone and formality level
- Consider mental health terminology sensitivity
- Preserve formatting placeholders (like `<br>` tags)
- Have native speakers review translations

Example:
```javascript
var translations = {
    english: {
        welcome_message: 'Welcome to NCMH Platform'
    },
    arabic: {
        welcome_message: 'ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿßŸã ÿ®ŸÉ ŸÅŸä ŸÖŸÜÿµÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ŸÉÿ≤ ÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜŸä ŸÑŸÑÿµÿ≠ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜŸÅÿ≥Ÿäÿ©'
    }
};
```
